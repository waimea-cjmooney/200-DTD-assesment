## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 20/5/24

Today I worked on the general flowchart of the website. I sent a screenshot of this version to Jess for requested changes that she wanted.

The flowchart shows how users will "flow" through the website this will show me how to program the website in a way that is intuitive and has no pages that the user might get stuck on.

### 21/05/24

I edited the flowchart again to include some things i accidentally missed the first time. I am still awaiting a response from jess
