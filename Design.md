# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cat Photo Website**

Project Author: **Corban Mooney**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Cat enthusiasts love sharing cat photos online, however it is often found annoying by non-cat owners. Having a dedi-***cat***-ed website would not only hide the photos from people who wish not to view them, but also allow for easier access to the photos.

### End-User Requirements

Cat enthusiasts come from all walks of life, and can be young or old. This means that any system must use clear and simple language, and be suitable for people of any age. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used. 

The level of IT expertise of the users could vary from high to very low. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use. 

Cat spotters love cats, so the system should be nicely designed, possibly with a cat theme.
